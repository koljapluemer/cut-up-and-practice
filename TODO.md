- implement mechanism for users to give feedback
- remove dead code
- check all files for insufficient inline-comments
- refactor 1 function
- think about accessibility strategies
- think about SEO strategies


- overview with last practiced songs, stats, progress :)
- tool for cutting up stuff (but not needed for me yet...)
- give feedback that button pressed, maybe disable and enable

- basic README
- possibly demo video

- warning when no snippets loaded;show snippets when loaded

- definitely would be more pleasant if we establish a min amount for all snippets involved, then raise the bar
	- also the science ofc would appreciate an A/B test:
		1. equal-opportunity SR for all snippets
		2. threshold to cross for parts of snippets before grouped snippets legal
		3. completely random
		- and then measure motivation as well as how fast avg climbs
		- ...but at that point, need new song
- also establish basic trailing avg instead of counting all the first 100 failed attempts for a snippet which will keep it repeated forever
- other, sneaky A-B test idea:
	1. establish one condition where we optimize for some failure rate, picking harder or easier to keep (another arbitrary) failure rate consistent
	2. establish one where you go full SR, least likely success gets repeated first
	3. randomly pick them for a session, then go for either just session-length tracking or maybe a moti-question (or threat/challenge) question on occasion
- if I hash filenames, could rather ethically gather data w/o much risk
